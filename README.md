# Disaster Response Pipeline for Figure Eight
This project is part of the Udacity - Data Science Nano-Degree.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to apply data engineering skills, to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

### Methods Used
* ETL Pipeline
* ML Pipeline
* Flask Web App

### Technologies (Currently)
* Python
* Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy
* SQLite
* scikit-learn

## Project Description
In this project, I applied data engineering skills to analyse disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. I created an Extract, Transform and load (ETL) process that takes in the messages and categories datasets and merges the two datasets, cleans the data and stores it in a SQLite database. I then created a machine learning pipeline to categorise these events so that I could send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency. My project also includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualisations of the data.
